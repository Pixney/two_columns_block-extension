# two_columns_block-extension

## Install
 * `php artisan addon:install two_columns_block`
* Import / Copy or write your own css `two_columns_block-extension/resources/sass/public.scss`
* publish the addon `php artisan addon:publish two_columns_block` and edit any html to your liking.

## Thought for the moment:
Using the field to crop with ratio 1:1.. Then use the picture element in html together with object fit to allow a lot of control..
